## Shapes in Rust

This repo is me learning the Rust programming language.
By making a terminal app that will take user input and calculate the
Area of different Shapes

### Usage

Clone the repository with:
```Shell
git clone {SSH/HTTPS}
```

Ensure you have Rust installed then proceed into the repository.

You can then run the code via:

```Shell
cargo build
```

This will run the application in the terminal.

### To Do

- [ ] While Loop for application rather than end after each usage.
- [ ] Learning Unit and Component Testing
- [ ] API application to serve to front end?
